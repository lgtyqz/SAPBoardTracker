# SAP Board Tracker

This script (`read-match-data.py`) uses HTTP requests to extract your last 20 games of Super Auto Pets and store it in `matches.db`.

Note that you will have to get your authorization token from the browser network inspection tools to make the automation work!

`matches.db` currently contains around 200ish boards, feel free to clear it if you want to start your own database, as I'm not sure this is on the newest Super Auto Pets patch.
